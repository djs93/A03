Git - Local version control system

Github - Online storage and viewer for Git repositories (online version control)

Repository - Tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time

Clone - Creating a copy of a repository

Commit - Confirming changes to a branch in a repository, bundles changes together

Push - Take changes from your local (on your computer) repository and upload them to a remote host (GitHub in our case)

Pull - Download changes and history from a remote host (GitHub in our case) and updates your local repository

Branch - Separate version of the same project, can edit it freely of modifying the master/other branches. Can be merged into other branches later.

Merge - Take a branch and combine its changes and history with another branch

Merge Conflict - When there are differences in a file's changes when attempting to merge two branches a merge conflict happens. This must be resolved before the merge can complete.

Fetch - Git gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in your current branch and stores them in your local repository. However, it does not merge them with your current branch.

Remote - Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. Usually this will be origin when using GitHub by default.
